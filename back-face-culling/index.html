    <h2>How to explore this demo</h2>
    <p>Two files are important:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>js/main.js – this is the file that sets up the animation</li>
      <li>js/renderer.js – this is the file that does the actual 3d animation</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can (and probably should!) ignore the rest of the files. These two
    files are heavily commented so dive in for more information.</p>

    <h2>Libraries used by this demo</h2>
    <p>This demo uses 2 libraries:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>RequireJS (http://requirejs.org/)<br>
      <em>Really useful for writing nice, organised Javascript</em></li>
      <li>glMatrix (http://glmatrix.net/)
      <em>Provides all the vector and matrix maths operations you could desire and
      works in a way that plays nicely with WebGL (should you want to explore
      that)</em></li>
    <ol>
